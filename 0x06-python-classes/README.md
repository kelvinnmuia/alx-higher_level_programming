# 0x06. Python - Classes and Objects
## The Domains/Concepts covered in this project: `Python`

The project introduced me to object oriented programming in python. At the end of the project I created classes and objects in python.

## **Background Context**

OOP is a totally new concept for all of you (especially those who think they know about it :)). Itâ€™s VERY important that you read at least all the material that is listed bellow (and skip what we recommend you to skip, you will see them later in the curriculum).

As usual, make sure you type (never copy and paste), test, understand all examples shown in the following links (including those in the video), test again etc. The biggest and most important takeaway of this project is: experiment by yourself OOP, play with it!

Read or watch the below resources in the order presented.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

**0. My first square**

Write an empty class `Square` that defines a square:

  * You are not allowed to import any module

```
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x06$ cat 0-main.py
#!/usr/bin/python3
Square = __import__('0-square').Square

my_square = Square()
print(type(my_square))
print(my_square.__dict__)

guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x06$ ./0-main.py
<class '0-square.Square'>
{}
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x06$ 
```

  * [0-square.py](./0-square.py): An empty python class that defines a square.

**1. Square with size**

Write a class `Square` that defines a square by: (based on `0-square.py`)

  * Private instance attribute: `size`
  * Instantiation with `size` (no type/value verification)
  * You are not allowed to import any module

**Why?**

Why `size` is private attribute?

The size of a square is crucial for a square, many things depend of it (area computation, etc.), so you, as 
class builder, must control the type and value of this attribute. One way to have the control is to keep it 
privately. You will see in next tasks how to get, update and validate the size value.

```
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x06$ cat 1-main.py
#!/usr/bin/python3
Square = __import__('1-square').Square

my_square = Square(3)
print(type(my_square))
print(my_square.__dict__)

try:
    print(my_square.size)
except Exception as e:
    print(e)

try:
    print(my_square.__size)
except Exception as e:
    print(e)

guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x06$ ./1-main.py
<class '1-square.Square'>
{'_Square__size': 3}
'Square' object has no attribute 'size'
'Square' object has no attribute '__size'
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x06$ 
```

  * [1-square.py](./1-square.py): Python Square class that defines a square by: (based on `0-square.py`)
