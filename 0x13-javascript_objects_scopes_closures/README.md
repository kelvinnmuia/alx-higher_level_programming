# 0x13. JavaScript - Objects, Scopes and Closures
## The Domains/Concepts covered in this project: `JavaScript`

This project introduced me into JavaScript Objects, Scopes and Closures. At the end of the project I created JavaScript objects fr0m classes.

## Background Context
JavaScript is used for many things. Here, you will use JavaScript for 2 reasons:

  * Scripting (same as we did with Python)
  * Web front-end

For the moment, and for learning all basic concepts of this language, we will do some scripting. 
After, we will make our AirBnB project dynamic by using Javascript and JQuery.
